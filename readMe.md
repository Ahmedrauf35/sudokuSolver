Same story as first project, work for my Data Structures class.

The purpose of this project is to take a partially solved Soduku board made up of 81 cells and find the solution. 

After doing this project, I have tentative plans to work on a rudimentary command line chess game, using the Mini-max Algorithm. -> key word tentative!
