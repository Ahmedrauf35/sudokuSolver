Same story as first project, work for my Data Structures class.

The purpose of this project is to take a partially solved Sudoku board made up of 81 cells and find the solution, using the established rules of Sudoku. (See https://sudoku.com/how-to-play/sudoku-rules-for-complete-beginners/) Note: Each 0 represents an empty cell. 

The first part of the solution (in Sudoku.cpp) requires one to transform the array with 81 values into a 2D array, which represents the 9x9 grid in Sudoku.
After doing so, the board is then evaluated following the rules of Sudoku (see link above), which is implemented using the *backtracking algorithm.* You can see a number of helper functions, used to improve the readability of the code.  

After doing this project, I have *tentative* plans to work on a rudimentary command line chess game, using the Mini-max Algorithm. -> key word tentative!
